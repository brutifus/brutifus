All notable changes to brutifus will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

brutifus follows a year.month.release versioning scheme, i.e.: yyyy.mm.v


## [TODO]
  - (!) allow to abort the continuum fitting with CTRL-C
  - `run_crude_snr_maps`: compute proper S/N for bright stars (not <>/std !)
  - enable minorticks in colorbars (see astropy bug `[8126] <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/8126>`_)
  - set the color of NaN pixels in plots ... (see astropy bug `[8165] <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/8165>`_)
  - when drawing contours in `run_skysub()`, show the actual pixel edges
  - allow for an automated selection of the sky areas -> requires a better snr estimate ?
  - (?) use `config.parser` to feed in the parameters, instead of YAML
  - (?) add scalebar to plots ... tricky: what if pix scale not uniform, North not up, etc ...
