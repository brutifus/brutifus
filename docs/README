To generate all the function docs automatically, use

cd ./docs/
sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/modules/ ../brutifus/

and change the title in modules.rst to “The functions of brutifus”

To build the site:

sphinx-build -a -b html source ../../brutifus_docs

NOTE: the docs are living on their own brutifus.github.io repository. The previous command assumes that the folder *brutifus_docs* is a clone of that repository (created, for example, using "git clone https://github.com/brutifus/brutifus.github.io.git"). If that is the case, one should do the following to upload the docs to the web


cd ../../brutifus_docs
git add -A .
git commit -a -m "Update docs"
git push origin master
